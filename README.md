Sign Recognition System
📌 Overview

The Sign Recognition System is a computer vision–based project that detects and classifies signs from images using deep learning techniques. The system focuses on image preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training to accurately recognize different sign categories, demonstrating the practical use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in real-world vision tasks.



🚀 Features

Image preprocessing and normalization

Automatic feature extraction using CNNs

Sign classification from input images

Trained deep learning model for accurate recognition

Modular and extensible project structure



🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

NumPy

OpenCV

TensorFlow / PyTorch

Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab



⚙️ How It Works

Input images are collected and preprocessed (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

A CNN model is trained to learn visual patterns from the images.

The trained model predicts the class of a sign for a given input image.

Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy.



▶️ How to Run

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-recognition.git
